## development dependencies

Sepia relies on [Premake 4.x](https://github.com/premake/premake-4.x) (x â‰¥ 3) to generate build configurations. Follow these steps to install it:
  - __Debian / Ubuntu__: Open a terminal and execute the command `sudo apt install premake4`.
  - __macOS__: Open a terminal and execute the command `brew install premake`. If the command is not found, you need to install Homebrew first with the command<br />
  `ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`.

[ClangFormat](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) is used to unify coding styles. Follow these steps to install it:
- __Debian / Ubuntu__: Open a terminal and execute the command `sudo apt install clang-format`.
- __macOS__: Open a terminal and execute the command `brew install clang-format`. If the command is not found, you need to install Homebrew first with the command<br />
